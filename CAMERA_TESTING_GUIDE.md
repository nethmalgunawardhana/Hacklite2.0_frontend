# Camera Handling Testing Guide

This guide covers testing the enhanced camera handling features for ASL detection, including color mode verification, orientation handling, and image quality validation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Requirements Overview

### 1. Color Mode Verification

- âœ… Camera captures in full color (RGB), not grayscale
- âœ… Uses `ImageFormatGroup.jpeg` format
- âœ… YUV420 to RGB conversion maintains color information

### 2. Orientation Handling

- âœ… Device orientation detection
- âœ… Image rotation correction if needed
- âœ… Consistent results across portrait/landscape modes

### 3. Image Quality

- âœ… `ResolutionPreset.high` for better quality
- âœ… 95% JPEG compression for color preservation
- âœ… Cubic interpolation for smoother resizing

## ðŸ§ª Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Color Mode Testing

1. **Start the app** and navigate to the camera page
2. **Check console logs** for image format detection:

   ```
   ðŸ“¸ Processing image: 1280x720, format: ImageFormatGroup.yuv420, planes: 3
   âœ… Converted YUV420 to full color RGB image (1280x720)
   ðŸ“¤ Uploading XXXX bytes JPEG image to backend
   ```

3. **Enable debug image saving** (optional):

   - Uncomment the test image saving code in `testImageCapture` method
   - Add path_provider import: `import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';`
   - Call `await _backendService.testImageCapture(cameraImage)` in detection loop

4. **Visual verification**:
   - Captured images should show full color (not grayscale)
   - Hand skin tones should be natural
   - Background colors should be preserved

### Step 2: Orientation Testing

1. **Test in Portrait Mode**:

   - Hold device vertically
   - Start ASL detection
   - Make several ASL gestures
   - Note prediction accuracy

2. **Test in Landscape Mode**:

   - Rotate device horizontally
   - Start ASL detection
   - Make the same ASL gestures
   - Compare prediction accuracy with portrait mode

3. **Rotation Correction** (if needed):
   - If backend receives rotated images, uncomment this line in `_convertAndResizeImage`:
     ```dart
     image = img.copyRotate(image, angle: -90); // Rotate counter-clockwise by 90Â°
     ```
   - Test again in both orientations

### Step 3: Image Quality Testing

1. **Resolution Verification**:

   - Check logs for original resolution: should be higher with `ResolutionPreset.high`
   - Typical resolutions: 1280x720 or 1920x1080 (device dependent)

2. **JPEG Quality Test**:

   - Compare file sizes with different quality settings
   - 95% quality should produce larger, clearer images
   - Check for compression artifacts in saved test images

3. **Performance Impact**:
   - Monitor frame processing time
   - Check network latency (should be similar despite higher quality)
   - Verify device doesn't overheat during extended use

## ðŸ“‹ Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Color Fidelity

**Objective**: Verify full color capture and processing

**Steps**:

1. Start camera in good lighting
2. Hold up colored objects (red, blue, green items)
3. Enable debug logging
4. Start ASL detection
5. Check logs for "full color RGB" conversion messages

**Expected Results**:

- Console shows YUV420 â†’ RGB color conversion
- No "grayscale fallback" warnings
- Colors appear natural in any saved test images

### Test Case 2: Orientation Consistency

**Objective**: Ensure consistent ASL detection across orientations

**Test Gestures**: A, B, C, Hello, Thank you

**Steps**:

1. Portrait mode: Perform each gesture 3 times, record accuracy
2. Landscape mode: Perform same gestures 3 times, record accuracy
3. Compare accuracy rates between orientations

**Expected Results**:

- Similar accuracy rates (within 10%) between orientations
- No significant drop in confidence scores
- Consistent letter recognition

### Test Case 3: Image Quality Impact

**Objective**: Validate higher quality improves ASL recognition

**Comparison Test**:

1. Test with `ResolutionPreset.medium` + 90% quality
2. Test with `ResolutionPreset.high` + 95% quality
3. Use same gestures and lighting conditions

**Metrics to Compare**:

- Average confidence scores
- Recognition accuracy
- Processing time per frame
- Network upload size

### Test Case 4: Format Compatibility

**Objective**: Test different camera format handling

**Device Testing**:

- Test on Android devices (typically YUV420)
- Test on iOS devices (typically BGRA8888 or JPEG)
- Check console logs for format detection

**Expected Behavior**:

- YUV420: Full color conversion
- BGRA8888: RGB conversion with alpha
- JPEG: Direct decode
- Unknown formats: Graceful fallback

## ðŸ”§ Debug Configuration

### Enable Enhanced Logging

Add this to your test configuration:

```dart
// In camera_page_v2.dart, add to _startDetection():
if (kDebugMode) {
  // Test first captured image
  cameraStreamController.stream.take(1).listen((image) async {
    await _aslService.testImageCapture(image);
  });
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics during testing:

- Frame processing time
- Network upload latency
- Memory usage
- Battery consumption
- Device temperature

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Grayscale Images

**Symptoms**: Console shows "grayscale fallback" warnings
**Solutions**:

1. Check camera initialization includes `imageFormatGroup: ImageFormatGroup.jpeg`
2. Verify YUV conversion is working properly
3. Test on different devices

### Issue: Rotated Detection Results

**Symptoms**: ASL gestures not recognized properly in landscape
**Solutions**:

1. Enable rotation correction: `image = img.copyRotate(image, angle: -90)`
2. Test different rotation angles: -90, 90, 180
3. Compare with web frontend behavior

### Issue: Poor Recognition Quality

**Symptoms**: Low confidence scores, incorrect predictions
**Solutions**:

1. Increase JPEG quality to 98%
2. Use `ResolutionPreset.max` if device supports it
3. Improve lighting conditions
4. Check network connectivity

### Issue: Performance Problems

**Symptoms**: Slow processing, UI lag, overheating
**Solutions**:

1. Reduce to `ResolutionPreset.high` (from max)
2. Lower JPEG quality to 90-95%
3. Increase frame interval (reduce FPS)
4. Profile memory usage
