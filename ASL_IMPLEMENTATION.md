# ASL Detection Implementation

## 🎯 What We've Built

This implementation provides American Sign Language (ASL) detection using:

- **Google ML Kit Pose Detection** for hand landmark extraction
- **Rule-based gesture recognition** for basic ASL letters
- **Flutter Camera** for real-time video capture
- **Extensible architecture** for future ML model integration

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Setup

- ✅ Dependencies installed (Google ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite, Camera)
- ✅ Project structure with services, models, and utilities
- ✅ Assets folder for future ML models

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Detection Service

- ✅ `ASLDetectionService` - Main service for gesture detection
- ✅ `HandLandmarkProcessor` - Processes hand landmarks and recognizes gestures
- ✅ `ASLPrediction` model - Data structure for predictions

### ✅ Phase 3: Camera Integration

- ✅ Updated `CameraPage` with real-time detection
- ✅ Start/Stop detection functionality
- ✅ Live prediction display with confidence scores
- ✅ Sentence building from detected letters

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the app** and navigate to the Camera tab
2. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted
3. **Tap "Start Detection"** to begin ASL recognition
4. **Show hand signs** to the camera
5. **View predictions** in real-time with confidence scores
6. **See detected letters** build into sentences
7. **Tap "Stop Detection"** to pause
8. **Use "Clear Sentence"** to reset detected text

## 🤖 Current Recognition Capabilities

### Rule-Based Recognition (Active)

- **A**: Closed fist
- **D**: Index finger extended
- **L**: Index finger and thumb extended (L shape)
- **V**: Index and middle fingers extended
- **B**: All fingers extended (simplified)

### Detection Confidence

- **High confidence**: >80% (Green indicator)
- **Medium confidence**: 60-80% (Orange indicator)
- **Low confidence**: <60% (Not displayed)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ASL Detection Pipeline

1. **Camera Frame Capture** → Take photo every 800ms
2. **Pose Detection** → Extract hand landmarks using Google ML Kit
3. **Landmark Processing** → Normalize and analyze hand positions
4. **Gesture Recognition** → Rule-based classification
5. **Result Display** → Show letter with confidence score

### Key Components

**ASLDetectionService**

- Singleton service managing detection lifecycle
- Initializes Google ML Kit pose detector
- Processes camera frames and returns predictions
- Supports both rule-based and ML model inference

**HandLandmarkProcessor**

- Normalizes hand landmarks relative to wrist position
- Calculates finger angles and extensions
- Implements rule-based gesture recognition
- Validates hand pose quality

**Camera Integration**

- Real-time frame processing every 800ms
- Automatic sentence building from detected letters
- Live confidence scoring and visual feedback
- Start/stop controls for detection

## 🚀 Next Steps for Enhancement
